# Interpretation of the CSV Standard by Java Libraries

Unfortunately, there is no real industry standard for CSV files.
The closest thing we do currently have (since 2005) is [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).
Working with non-standardized data often comes with surprises, but what exactly happens when parsing
CSV data that doesn't match this RFC?

This project is about to find that out...

## Test results

The [test suite](tests) consists of currently 60 tests in total.
To pass a test, the library must return the expected result or throw an exception if the input is invalid.
If the library lacks a feature (like skipping empty lines or comments), the test is marked as skipped.
If a test is neither passed nor skipped, it is marked as failed.

The tests clearly show that there are significant differences between the libraries â€“
especially when it comes to non-standardized data.

## Execute

To run the tests and generate the report locally, execute the following command:

```shell
./gradlew test allureAggregateServe
```

## Library Implementor?

The tests are written in a way that they can be easily adapted to other libraries and languages.
They can also be used as unit tests for your library, like done in [FastCSV].

Feel free to use the tests for your own project.
